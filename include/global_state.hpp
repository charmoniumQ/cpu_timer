	  I want all funcs in this translation-unit to share the same

	  I want all translation-units to share the same process,
	  therefore it must be a pointer.

	  I could have no individual client responsible for creating the
	  process; the first one which needs it would create it. But I
	  decided instead to bless one client with the responsibility of
	  making the process, while the others just look it up.

	  Cons:

	  - One lib has to be "special".

	  Pros:

	  - It has a single site to specify "initial configuration,"
	  without which, I would have to construct the Process in a
	  half-initialized state.

	  - No race on the fs to publish `make_process` tempfile.

	  However, the lib responsible for making won't necessarily be
	  loaded first or unloaded last. In such a case, hence each client
	  needs to hold a std::shared_ptr<...>.

	  It also needs to be lazily-loaded (not initailized at
	  load-time), because it is possible nobody has called
	  `make_process` yet. `get_process()` can still use
	  branch-prediction to make it fast in the steady-state despite
	  lazy-initialization (having to check if it is initialized).
